# Welcome to the Salesforce DevOps Center Public Beta!

DevOps Center provides an end-to-end, UI-based experience for change and release management when developing on the Salesforce platform. Ready to try a more modern, automated, and repeatable process than what change sets provide? Want to take advantage of source control as part of your Salesforce development experience? Looking for a seamless push-button interface to migrate changes across the various stages of your deployment pipeline?  You've come to the right place!

## We Need Your Feedback

This beta will only be successful if we hear from you! We're excited to provide you with this early look at DevOps Center, and in return we ask that you provide us with honest feedback on your experiences with the product and documentation. Don't be shy! Your feedback is what will make this product better for our entire community.

This private shared repository is the central location for sharing information and collecting your feedback. Use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/forcedotcom/devops-center-feedback/issues) above to capture bugs, feature requests, and other general observations. Access to this repository is limited to beta participants and members of the DevOps Center product team at Salesforce.

## Support During Beta

When you require support during the beta, open a GitHub issue. It's easier for us to track it and respond, and other beta participants can see it in case they're having a similar issue.

Our general SLA is to respond to inquiries within 2 business days. Although we can't guarantee fixes during this beta period, we'll provide workarounds, when possible, as well as patches for critical issues as needed.
